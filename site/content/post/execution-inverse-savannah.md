I was at the pier in my neighborhood Poblenou this morning, and I witnessed a breathtaking sunrise. The time was 9:23 am, and the sun was reflecting off the water, creating a bright and beautiful scene. As I stood there taking in the view, I noticed a man riding his bicycle along the pier. When I took a photo of him, the man appeared dark in contrast to the bright reflection of the sun. It was a stunning moment that reminded me of the beauty of nature and the simple joys in life.
